Hello!

This Unity game is an open-source submission for the 2015 WAG Challenge by ertopena@github (design, code, art), pintobeam@github (design, code), and twitter.com/the_drigo (design, writing, music). Feel free to take a look in our files and reach out to us directly if you have any questions or comments on the game.

When the game is available to play online, we will update this with a link.

Thanks for playing!
